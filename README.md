# House-Pricing

## Overview of the Project

The aim of the project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the prices of the houses
in Ames City, Iowa, USA for the sellers by using the train.csv dataset retrieved from Kaggle website 
(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data?select=train.csv), 
and create an interactive website for the users where they can filter for multiple search criteria at 
the same time by using all or some of the variables below as input:

- Lot Area (in square feet)
- Lot Shape
- Neighbourhood
- Building Type
- Year Built
- Year Remodeled
- Heating Type
- Total House Square Feet
- Number of Full Bathrooms
- Number of Half Bathrooms
- Number of Bedrooms above ground floor
- Fireplaces (Yes/No)
- Garage Type
- Garage Car Numbers
- Paved Drive
- Pool (Yes/No)
- Year Sold
- Sale Price

The stages of the project with the list of technologies to be used are as follows:

- Cleaning, Preparing and Exploring the Data
	* Jupyter Notebook
	* Pandas
	* Numpy
	* Matplotlib
- Geocoding 
	* Tableau
- Visualizing Database
	* ERD
- Creating Tables
	* PostgreSQL
- Training and Executing Machine Learning Model
	* AWS, Machine Learning
- Presentation of Data Visualization
	* HTML, Javascript, CSS
- Calling a Model
	* Flask

## Results

In the first stage of the project, the train dataset was cleaned and filtered for useful criteria,
and saved as csv and xlsx files. Then, based on the updated data, an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) and a SQL script were created in PostgreSQL, and committed to GitHub.
